stir_teams_apart (circa 2013)
=============================

Use a collaborative filtering machine learning recommender system to assign members to teams based on their calculated interest, whether they voted for that team or not.

Input data should be a CSV file with headers that begin with `Timestamp` and `Username`, then followed by one column for each item. In the example data, the columns were the pitches being voted on by audience members; in the format generated by a Google Docs form submission (from 2013). Each row in the CSV represents rankings submitted by one user. A user does not need to rank each item, and the same user can submit more than one ranking. Previous rankings are ignored.

The output is a printed list of the top 7 highest rated pitches, with an even number of audience members assigned to each pitch. Audience members are assigned based on their actual or predicted interest. Predicted interest is inferred using Collaborative Filtering.

The name is inspired by a line from a Tom Stoppard play where, after seeing jam mixed into pudding, Thomasina ask why you cannot “stir things apart?”

## Usage
